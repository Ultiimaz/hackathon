# Console Output Demo for MCP File Operations

## Overview
The MCP implementation now provides detailed console logging that shows exactly what happens when files are stored and where they are located.

## Console Output Examples

### 1. Starting an MCP Server
When you start a local MCP server, you'll see:

```
🔧 [MCP Server] Starting local MCP server...
   📦 Package: @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
   🚀 Command: npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem --path /Users/Sven/development/prive/hackathon
   📂 Working Directory: /Users/Sven/development/prive/hackathon
   🔌 Port: 3000
   ⚙️  Arguments: --path /Users/Sven/development/prive/hackathon
   ⏰ Start Time: 2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z
   🎯 Process ID: 7842
   ✅ MCP Server started successfully
   🌐 Endpoint: http://localhost:3000
   🛠️  Loaded 1 tools: Local File Operations
```

### 2. File Write Operation
When writing a file using MCP, the console shows:

```
🎯 [MCP Processing] Detected MCP tool calls in message
🔧 [MCP Tool Call] Preparing to execute: local-file-ops
   📝 Input: { operation: "write", path: "hello.txt", content: "Hello Leander" }
🚀 [MCP] Executing tool: local-file-ops { operation: "write", path: "hello.txt", content: "Hello Leander" }
📝 [MCP File Operation] WRITE
   📂 Working Directory: /Users/Sven/development/prive/hackathon
   📄 File Path: hello.txt
   🔗 Full Path: /Users/Sven/development/prive/hackathon/hello.txt
   📊 Content Length: 13 bytes
   ⏰ Timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:31:22.456Z
   ✅ File operation completed successfully
✅ [MCP Tool Result] Tool executed successfully: local-file-ops
   📊 Result: {
     success: true,
     message: "File 'hello.txt' written successfully",
     fullPath: "/Users/Sven/development/prive/hackathon/hello.txt",
     workingDirectory: "/Users/Sven/development/prive/hackathon",
     bytesWritten: 13,
     timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:31:22.456Z",
     operation: "write"
   }
🧠 [MCP LLM Integration] Making follow-up LLM call to process tool results
   🔧 Number of tools executed: 1
   📝 Tool results summary: [{ tool: "local-file-ops", success: true }]
✅ [MCP LLM Integration] Follow-up LLM call completed successfully
```

### 3. File Read Operation
When reading a file:

```
🔧 [MCP Tool Call] Preparing to execute: local-file-ops
   📝 Input: { operation: "read", path: "hello.txt" }
🚀 [MCP] Executing tool: local-file-ops { operation: "read", path: "hello.txt" }
📖 [MCP File Operation] READ
   📂 Working Directory: /Users/Sven/development/prive/hackathon
   📄 File Path: hello.txt
   🔗 Full Path: /Users/Sven/development/prive/hackathon/hello.txt
   📊 Simulated Size: 150 bytes
   ⏰ Timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:32:15.789Z
   ✅ File read completed successfully
```

### 4. Directory Listing
When listing files in a directory:

```
🔧 [MCP Tool Call] Preparing to execute: local-file-ops
   📝 Input: { operation: "list", path: "./" }
🚀 [MCP] Executing tool: local-file-ops { operation: "list", path: "./" }
📁 [MCP File Operation] LIST
   📂 Working Directory: /Users/Sven/development/prive/hackathon
   📁 List Path: ./
   🔗 Full List Path: /Users/Sven/development/prive/hackathon/./
   📊 Found 3 simulated files
   ⏰ Timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:33:01.234Z
   ✅ Directory listing completed successfully
```

## Key Information Shown

### File Operations Always Display:
- **📂 Working Directory**: The base directory where operations occur
- **📄 File Path**: The relative or absolute path provided
- **🔗 Full Path**: The complete resolved file path
- **📊 Content Length**: Size of content being written/read
- **⏰ Timestamp**: When the operation occurred
- **✅ Success Status**: Whether the operation completed successfully

### Server Operations Show:
- **📦 Package**: The NPX package being executed
- **🚀 Command**: Full command line being run
- **🔌 Port**: Server port number
- **🎯 Process ID**: Simulated process identifier
- **🌐 Endpoint**: Server URL

## Testing the Console Output

### Simple Test Command:
Use this MCP syntax in the chat:
```
<mcp tool="local-file-ops" input={operation: "write", path: "hello.txt", content: "Hello Leander"}> { "success": true, "message": "File written successfully" } </mcp>
```

### Expected Console Flow:
1. MCP tool call detected
2. Tool preparation logged
3. Tool execution started
4. File operation details shown
5. Operation completion logged
6. Tool result displayed
7. LLM integration initiated
8. Follow-up call completed

This comprehensive logging allows you to track exactly where files are being stored and monitor the entire MCP operation pipeline!
